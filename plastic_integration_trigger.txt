To use the webhook and get data from plastic-->

1) The users going to do operations on plastic platform should have plastic installed and 
   configured (Thats a must otherwise one can't use plastic scm)

2) The endpoint for the webhook is "/webhook_plastic" if it is running locally it will be like 
   http://127.0.0.1:8000/webhook_plastic (otherwise the url will change as per hosting but the endpoint
   will be same)

3) to run get different data from plastic one should configure the triggers
    the basic command is-> cm trigger create after-mkrep CiNotifierWebTrigger "webtrigger http://127.0.0.1:8000/webhook_plastic" --server=g_p_s___main@cloud

    now you can change the url as told on pt.2  and also the types of triggers acc to your need
    (here, after-mkrep is the trigger)

Thats it!!

Remember to do this on every machine using plastic scm

Note: after every trigger is fired, the data will come to this django project
      The webhook is set at core folder (check views.py and urls.py you will get webhook_plastic)
      and do the following changes as per requirement
